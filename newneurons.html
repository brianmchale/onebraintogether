        <p>Roadmaps are often nothing more than empty promises that serve as incentive to buy into scams. That’s what we're not going to do.</p>
		<p><b>NEW NEURONS</b> is a collection of 111 pieces by Brian McHale that explore the intersection of photography and AI art. Each image is run through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), where it is recreated by an AI either as a Static image or a Dynamic animation. <There are <b>100 Static Neurons</b> and <b>10 Dynamic Neurons</b>. The 111th piece is [redacted].<p>
		<p><b>NEW NEURONS</b> is also the first point of entry into One Brain Together and acts as your community access token. Collectors will receive the following utility:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Free admission</b> to all One Brain Together events</li>
				<li>Creative contribution to <b>community-owned projects</b> </li>
				<li>Exclusive <b>airdrops, giveaways, & allowlist</b> access <br> </li>
				<li>Apparel and more...</li> 
			</ul> 
			</p>

	<p>There will be four Phases to this project. Phase 1 begins <b>March 22nd, 2022</b> on Foundation. It will consist of <b>10 Static Neurons</b> and <b>1 Dynamic Neuron</b>, all @ 0.1Ξ each.</p>
